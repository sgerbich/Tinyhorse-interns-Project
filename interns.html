      <h4>EXPERIENCE IS KING</h4>
      <p>
        We believe you learn better by doing. Our internship program was built
        to give you real experience, guided by one of our team members here in
        Charlotte, NC or Los Angeles, CA who actually works in your area of
        interest. On top of that, we offer engaging learning sessions directly
        with our senior leadership where you can ask questions and dig into real
        projects. Our program was handcrafted by previous interns to create an
        enjoyable, yet challenging experience.

                direction of a mentor, interns use their skills and abilities to
